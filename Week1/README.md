Week 1:

studied the mathematical fundamentals required for data analysis, with a focus on probability theory and random variables including topics such as sample spaces, probability axioms, conditional probability, independance, Bayes theorem, total probability theorem, etc.

learned about discrete and continuous random variables, including probability mass functions (PMF) and probability density functions (PDF). I explored common probability distributions such as Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Gamma, Beta, and Chi-square, and understood how to compute their mean, variance, and moment generating functions.

covered expectation, variance, covariance, and correlation, along with their properties and applications. Studied joint and conditional distributions and criteria for independence between variables.

practiced numerical computing and data visualization using NumPy and Matplotlib. Performed array creation and manipulation, including indexing, slicing, reshaping, and vectorized operations. Computed statistical measures such as mean, variance, and standard deviation, and applied these operations efficiently using NumPy functions.

this was then followed by an assignment to be solved.
