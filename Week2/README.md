Studied univariate time-series analysis and stationarity testing, with emphasis on the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test

Studied linear regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

Explored multivariate time-series concepts and cointegration for pairs trading strategies


Exercise 1 – Multiple Linear Regression
Analyzed a regression model with interaction terms, interpreted coefficient effects, compared salary outcomes across gender, computed predictions, and evaluated interaction significance.

Exercise 2 – Simple Linear Regression
Implemented OLS regression with mpg vs horsepower, interpreted the model summary, generated predictions with confidence and prediction intervals, plotted the regression line, and assessed model assumptions using diagnostic plots.

Exercise 3 – Stationarity Testing
Plotted the price series, conducted an ADF test on log-prices to assess stationarity, calculated the half-life of mean reversion, and evaluated the feasibility of a mean-reversion trading strategy.

Exercise 4 – Cointegration & Pairs Trading 
Analyzed correlation, estimated a hedge ratio using OLS, constructed the spread portfolio, tested for stationarity with ADF, and computed half-life to determine tradeability.
