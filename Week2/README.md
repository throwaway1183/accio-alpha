# Week-2 Resources
---
This week will be a bit intensive for those who have not covered these topics before, so take your time going through the resources. I would recommend asking any doubts you have on the group so it not only helps you but also helps others having similar doubts


## Time Series Analysis (Univariate) 
You need to make sure you are familiar with time series analysis and can perform stationarity tests (especially, ADF) so here's the Notion page we created to get you familiar with it: [Notion page](https://pantalaimon.notion.site/WiDS-Week-2-2cab2bd16afa80d7950fd3c0b11c11fd?source=copy_link)


## Regression and OLS
- Refer to this awesome StatsQuest [video](https://youtu.be/nk2CQITm_eo?si=WDZI1HbkRWODaDt7) on linear regression
Ordinary Least Squares is a vital tool for regression analysis
- Chapter 3 of [book](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~rabbee/s154/ISLR_First_Printing.pdf)
- [This](https://youtu.be/8tAPsX0YuNE?si=HjoJl-kMnCf6qApK) video is a great start for OLS
- Refer to these [lecture slides](https://www.sfu.ca/~dsignori/buec333/lecture%208.pdf) too


## Time series analysis (Multivariate) - Optional
The analysis and study we have done till now was for univariate time series and now its time to dive into multivariate time series. Here is the Notion page we created to get you familiar with it: [Notion page](https://pantalaimon.notion.site/WiDS-Week-2-Part-2-2cbb2bd16afa80de82bee54113efd650?source=copy_link)


## Exercise: <br />
To make sure you are comfortable with this week's material, there is an assignment for you to solve. Note all your key thoughts down in the markdown of a jupyter notebook that you are working with. Interesting conclusions from data too would be appreciated :)
